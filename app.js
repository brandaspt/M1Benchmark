HINTS:

/ When questionNumber is bigger then the available questions, present the score
/ Start working with the question saved in a variable, and then include AJAX etc
/ Start with the easier version and THEN implement the EXTRAs
/ Please debug everything / try it on the console to be sure of what to expect from your code

EXTRA:
/ Show if the answer was wrong or correct after clicking

*/

/*
IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ALL THE QUESTIONS TOGETHER:
HINT: for each question, create a container with the "question"
create a radio button https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio with, as option the both the correct answer and the incorrect answers
when EVERY question has an answer (google for how to get a value from a radio button with JS)
IF YOU ARE DISPLAYING ONE QUESTION AT A TIME
Display first question with a title + radio button
when the user select the answer, pick the next question and remove this from the page after added in a varible the users' choice.
*/

/*
HOW TO calculate the result
You can do it in 2 ways:
If you are presenting all questions together, just take all the radio buttons and check if the selected answer === correct_answer
If you are presenting one question at a time, just add one point or not to the user score if the selected answer === correct_answer
